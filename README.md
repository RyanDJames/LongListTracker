# LongListTracker

## Some things that went well:
1. I was able to get a good grasp of color coding individual lines.
2. My knowledge in how to manipulate lines to look more professional
is much greater. Especially presenting the console window with a more
professional appearance.
3. My grasp of the usage of loops has greatly increased. I can now use
loops confidently in console apps.

## Things that went wrong:
1. I need more practice to grasp the concept of classes, and how to use
them properly.
2. There was quite a bit of redundancy in my code that could have been 
cleared up using methods more effectively.
3. Using multiple lists, and working with "pages" was a struggle for me, 
and I will need to continue practice with them.

## What I would do if I had two weeks longer to work on the project. 
1. I would solidify my usage of lists, to allow the user to imput many 
more tasks than they can at this point.
2. I would clean up the code, to have a more professional appearance.
3. I would begin upgrading the UI for the app. Allowing for directional
arrow key usage.
